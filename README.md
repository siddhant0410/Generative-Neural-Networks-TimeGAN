## Overview

TimeGAN combines adversarial training with supervised sequence learning and autoencoding to generate synthetic time-series that retain both **feature-level fidelity** and **temporal consistency**.

### Key Components:
- **Embedder & Recovery Network**: Learns a latent representation and reconstructs sequences.
- **Generator & Discriminator**: Adversarially trains to produce indistinguishable latent sequences.
- **Supervisor**: Guides temporal dynamics by learning latent step transitions.

## Datasets

### 1. **ARKF.csv** (Real-world financial data)
- Daily prices for ARK Fintech ETF: Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume
- ~293 observations

### 2. **heart_rate.csv** (Real-world physiological data)
- Multichannel ECG/PPG sequences

### 3. **Synthetic Sine Data**
- Multi-dimensional sine waves generated programmatically
- Used as a sanity check for temporal consistency
